# LogStack

Bare bones windows event log analyzer tool

## Concept

Many security frameworks require reviewing system logs for various indicators of compromise, or unusual activity.
For large scale systems (server-client archetecture, etc.) there are already tools (SIEMs) built for handling this.
Splunk and ArcSight are two examples of many.
While this SIEMs are quite effective, robust, and have quite a wide array of capabilities these tools are frequently 
large, resource itensive (in physical, logical, and business sense.) and expensive.

For smaller environments, such as single standalone computers these solutions are not a good fit.  As the organization
frequently does not have the money, manhours, or skill to utilize larger and more complicated SIEMs.  In these situations
the organization is frequently forced to rely on built-in system log viewing tools and or debugging tools such as the 
Windows Event Viewer or Auditd often found in Linux systems.  These tools vary widely in terms of functionality and how
intuitive they are to use.

## Scope

The idea behind LogStack is to address these issues for single computer environments runing a Windows operting system such 
as Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, etc.
